# onedrive-docker

This is a temporary testing repository to prove out the ability to deploy a onedrive docker container via a [helm chart](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/tree/master/charts/stable/onedrive) to a kubernetes instance. I plan on upstreaming any changes if and when possible so that this repo can be retired.
